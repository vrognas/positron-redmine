## Your Personal Timeline

See **your assigned issues** on a Gantt-style timeline. Unlike Redmine's project Gantt, this shows only your workload — helping you answer "Am I overbooked?"

### Features

- **Drag bar edges** - Adjust start/due dates
- **Drag from circle** - Create relations between issues
- **Heatmap toggle** - See your daily utilization (green/yellow/orange/red)
- **Progress bars** - Show done_ratio on each issue
- **Zoom levels** - Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year

Past portions show diagonal stripes. Parent issues appear as summary bars.
