## Personal Workload Management

This extension focuses on **your** work, not project-level oversight. Think of it as your personal Redmine dashboard — see your issues, log your time, plan your week.

### Setup Requirements

1. **Redmine URL** - Your server's HTTPS address (e.g., `https://redmine.example.com`)
2. **API Key** - Found in Redmine under *My Account* → *API access key*

Your credentials are stored securely in your system's encrypted keychain.
