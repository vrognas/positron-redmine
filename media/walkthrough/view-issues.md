## My Issues

The sidebar shows **issues assigned to you** — not all project issues. This keeps focus on your personal task list.

### Features

- **Tree View** - Your issues grouped by project hierarchy
- **Risk Indicators** - Color-coded by schedule status (at-risk, overbooked)
- **Quick Actions** - Click to update status, log time, or open in browser

Projects with your assigned issues appear highlighted at the top.
